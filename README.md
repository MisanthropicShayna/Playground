# Playground
This is a repository for programs and scripts that I wrote over time, that don't qualify my personal standard of quality to warrant their own repositories. They're either too poor in code quality, too specific to be useful, too experimental, or just designed to be thrown away from the start. I deleted a couple of my older repositories in favor of placing their code here, as they no longer meet my standards.
