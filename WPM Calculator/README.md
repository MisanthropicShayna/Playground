* WPM Calculator
This is just a simple, < 100 line program, to calculate typing speed, and to practice typing. Nothing fancy. This program differs slightly from other calculators, since it works on a word-by-word basis, rather than on a paragraph basis. It will sum the time it takes for you to write each individual word, excluding the delay between words. Therefore, the resulting words per minute only include the time you spent actually typing, and not staring / thinking about the word before typing. The resulting WPM may therefore appear higher.

This program reads from the provided _dictionary.txt_ file, which is just a list of words that you can replace with any other list of words in whatever language (warning, unicode not supported/intended).
